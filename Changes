2.2.2 - 2012-12-09
  - fix JSON serializer to work with random has seeds introduced in perl 5.17.6

2.2.1 - 2012-04-18
  - fixed test on perl < 5.14

2.2.0 - 2012-04-17
  - better error reports on failed deflation/inflation

2.1.11-TRIAL - 2012-02-22
  - use JSON instead of JSON::XS directly

2.1.10-TRIAL - 2012-02-21
  - improve ::Registry code, find_deflator returns inlined deflators if it exists
  - call deflators with the type constraint it is defined for,
    i.e. given a deflator that is defined for HashRef[] and a TC MyType that is
    defined as 'MyType, as HashRef[Str]', the deflator as passed the HashRef[Str]
    constraint instead of MyType. This simplifies the deflator code because you
    don't have to call ->parent on the type constraint until it is of the expected
    type. See the diff for ::Moose and ::Structured.
  - ::Moose now comes with a deflator and inflator for Bool types.
  - $attr->is_inflated is now inlined for better performance
  - renamed inline {} to inline_as {}

2.1.9-TRIAL - 2012-01-20
  - inline deflators and inflators
    huge performance improvement

2.1.8 - 2011-11-30
  - fixed structured.t to work with latest moose

2.1.7 - 2011-07-28
  - performance improvement by removing redundant call to is_inflated (thanks timbunce)

2.1.6 - 2011-06-20
  - readded support for Moose 1.25
  - added support for Moose 2.02 (doy)

2.1.5 - 2011-06-08
  - fixed is_inflated() returning false results when called
    while the object is being created

2.1.4 - 2011-04-12
  - better diagnostics when inflation/deflation fails
  - fixed bug where coercion didn't happen with Moose > 1.99

2.1.2 - 2011-04-11
  - added JSON prereq

2.1.1 - 2011-04-05
  - fixed role composition (doy)
  - fixed bogus prereqs

2.1.0 - 2011-03-17
  - Deflating/Inflating attributes can now be defined in roles
    and composed in a class that doesn't use LazyDeflator
    directly.

2.0.1 - 2011-03-17
  - deflate/inflate return now the value of the attribute
    even if no deflator/inflator could be found
  - has_deflator/inflator now work correctly with typed constraints

2.0.0
  - Moose 2.0 compliant
  - Moose 1.24 compliant (thanks doy)
  - Made mutable classes behavior consistent with immutable
  - Some speed improvement using inlining of code
  - Allow attributes without type constraints

    type constraint

1.130000 - 2010-10-10
  - Fixed compat with Moose 1.15

1.120001 - 2010-08-28

  - Mark attributes as being inflated on construction
    if they pass the type constraint

1.101640 - 2010-06-13

  - Refactored inflate/deflate and Registry for speed

1.100990 - 2010-04-09
